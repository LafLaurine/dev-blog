## To my french reader, I shall present you : [*La revue IA*](https://larevueia.fr/)

*La revue IA* explains what you need to know about artificial intelligence techniques. This website raises questions about the ethics of artificial intelligence and what it can be used for in health care. It also presents different algorithms for machine learning as well as a lot of explanations about neural networks and NLP.

### *But Laurine, how did you discover this wonderful website ?*

Well, one of my friend, [Jérôme Milot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milotjerome/?originalSubdomain=fr) is an editor at *La Revue IA*. He's currently studying at ENS Rennes (yeah I know, he's quite impressive). One day, I checked on social media and I discovered the [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Larevueia/) of *La Revue IA*. In litteraly five minutes, I was hooked up by the project. 

[Ilyes Talbi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilyes-talbi-ba2451135/?originalSubdomain=fr), the founder, spend a lot of his time to write understandable and interesting articles. He had the opportunity to go to AI Paris Corp and he did a [report](https://larevueia.fr/compte-rendu-de-lai-et-big-data-paris-corp/).

## Some of my favorite articles :


* [Basic exemple with Tensorflow](https://larevueia.fr/tensorflow/)

* [3 clustering methods](https://larevueia.fr/clustering-les-3-methodes-a-connaitre/)
