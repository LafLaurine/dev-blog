## Why researcher code is hard to read ?

the key performance indicators are all about paper publications, need to be first to publish your innovative paper, don't have time to clean everything. The code is just proof-of-concepts

most researchers are not programmers !! or they're specialized in 1 language  --> not realizing when refactoring is necessary  no introduction to computer programming 

don't get support when needed

early stage of deep learning, not really documentation

remember to make a sandwich when you say to someone something "mean": using a layer of compliments before and after you deliver your “oh your code is bad” message.
