## Why researcher code is hard to read ?

the key performance indicators are all about paper publications, need to be first to publish your innovative paper, don't have time to clean everything. The code is just proof-of-concepts

most researchers are not programmers !! or they're specialized in 1 language  --> not realizing when refactoring is necessary  no introduction to computer programming 

don't get support when needed

early stage of deep learning, not really documentation

Now that I am in my internship, I read a lot more research papers and I now know how to use a good reading technique

## How to read a research paper ?

When you read a research paper, you need to be **active**. You need to write down how the algorithm works, what is taken as input, what is the ouput and how they manage to process everything. Don't worry about evil mathematics formula, it's completly normal to be lost. You don't have to **understand everything**.

I take between 2 to 3 hours to read a paper, when it is not a huge one. It may happend that I take a day to read only one paper.

Start reading the abstract to have an overview of the topic and understand what the authors are doing. Then, read the introduction because it will give you a larger overview of the project.
Read the conclusion, it will summarize everything that has been written in the paper, it is relevant to understand why and how they did what they did.
The choice is yours for the rest, you can read results and the methodology or do the opposite. With this, you can understand better how authors did their job and what results they obtained. You can add it to your benchmark and even test it if they provide the source code.
