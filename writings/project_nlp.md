studies how machines understand human language :  Language comprehension, which is a formality for human beings, is an almost insurmountable challenge for machines.

With NLP, machines can make sense of written or spoken text and perform tasks like translation, keyword extraction, topic classification, and more.  but to automate there is a need of machine learning
