# How did I choose my subject and why ?

## Introduction

That's it. This is the last year of studies. I've come a long way! 
At the very beginning of my studies, I wanted to focus on graphic design and I was programming without any special predilection for it.
As more as I was programming, I found myself really happy and understanding things that I never thought I would. 
But there was a  problem! **I sucked at algorithms!** But I liked it so much, that even if I ran into a wall, I kept going.

                          I love to learn new things.


After two years of university, I got into an engineering school. I, who didn't think I was that good, managed to make my way between math and programming classes. I learned C, C++, OpenGL and so many other skills in this school.

Thanks to the projects I did, I was able to have this appetence that I have today: deep learning! Wow, what a surprise! I already knew about python before I started in this field and once I set foot in it, I never wanted to get out of it.
The field of artificial intelligence is very vast and you can quickly get lost in it. But I kept my head above water and here I am now. I'm going to devote part of my last year to a **deep learning project**. BECAUSE I LOVE IT.

I will soon start to be fully involved in this project. Anyway, why am I doing this project in the last year? Well, we have to do one in order to validate our last year (easy right?). As I'm doing a double degree (engineering degree and master one), I have to do two projects. But as I'm not crazy and there are other projects on the side, we have the opportunity to combine the two projects if it's big enough. For the engineering degree, we have to stay in the field of 3D and image, as it is our specialty. The master's degree is specialized in image processing, so we have to stay in this field.

What does it mean? No NLP! The deep learning that I want to use must therefore focus on the field of image and computer vision, as in the early days of the deep learning.

## My future

After my degree, I want to work in the deep learning field. Why ? Because I had opportunity to work on several projects that I loved and that makes me wanna work in this field. I think that if deep learning is put to good use, you can do wonderful things with it. Especially in the medical and defense fields. This is my dream job: to make an application using the principles of deep learning to do something useful and practical.
