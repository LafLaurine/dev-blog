## Introduction

If you've already read my article ["How did I choose my subject and why ?"](https://laurine-dev-blog.herokuapp.com/writings/subject), you know what my project is about. If not, here's a quick brief : my goal is to denoise an image using deep learning. After the denoising, I want to use NLP to automatically describe the content of the image. Indeed, if my image is denoised enough, I could describe it without a problem. That's the point of my project : denoise an image enough in order to describe the content of it.

## First step : reading research papers

The first step of a huge project like that is checking what already exists. That means : reading a lot of research papers. Check the article ["Ressources"](https://laurine-dev-blog.herokuapp.com/writings/ressources) to see all the papers I refer to. 

When you read a research paper, you need to be **active**. You need to write down how the algorithm works, what is taken as input, what is the ouput and how they manage to process everything. Don't worry about evil mathematics formula, it's completly normal to be lost. You don't have to **understand everything** (if you do, you're awesome).

Here an [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-you-should-read-research-papers-according-to-andrew-ng-stanford-deep-learning-lectures-98ecbd3ccfb3) that explain how to read a research papers by Andrew Ng. 

## Second step : testing

After reading all you need to, it's great to see how they have implemented their algorithms (if it's available online, which is not always the case). Github is your friend. Git clone repository that you find and test ! 
It's researcher code so it will be full of bugs (enjoy installing a lot of libraries for python and then have compability problems)

## Third step : take what's best in every algorithms

## Fourth step : merge everything

## Fifth step : neural network construction

## Sixth step : training neural network

## Seventh step :
